Since you came into my life, everything has felt a little brighter and more meaningful in ways I didn’t expect. Being with you brings a kind of calm and happiness that makes even the quiet moments feel full. I still think about how unlikely it was for us to meet, yet somehow we did, and I’ll never stop being grateful for that. Every day I spend with you, I find new things to appreciate and new hopes for the future, not just for myself, but for both of us. I want to keep learning who you are, keep choosing you, and keep hoping for a life that treats us gently. You’re one of the best things that’s ever happened to me, sayang.

Love,Isakh.`;
